Regularly updating the router's firmware is crucial, as many devices are deployed without updates, leaving them exposed to known security issues. Additionally, he suggests segmenting the network using VLANs to isolate IoT devices, which can help contain any breaches. Lastly, he highlights the need for vigilance and periodic checks to ensure the router remains secure against evolving threats.


--- 2020 ---
Steve emphasizes the importance of isolating IoT devices on a separate network to enhance home router security. He suggests using a guest WiFi feature on routers, which allows IoT devices to connect to the Internet without accessing the main network. If a router lacks this feature, he recommends setting up a second router or access point dedicated to IoT devices, ensuring they operate on a different subnet. Additionally, he advises disabling unnecessary services like UPnP and using strong, unique passwords for router management interfaces to prevent unauthorized access. Overall, the focus is on creating a layered security approach to protect the home network from potential vulnerabilities associated with IoT devices.

Steve emphasizes the importance of securing home routers by following several best practices. He advises disabling remote management features unless absolutely necessary, as these can expose the router to external attacks. Instead, he recommends using a single high-quality SSH server for remote access, which should require strong authentication methods, including a password, a certificate, and a time-based factor. Additionally, he suggests running the SSH server on a non-standard port to enhance security.

Steve also highlights the need to keep the router's firmware updated and to disable any unnecessary Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) that could introduce vulnerabilities. He stresses that all incoming traffic should be monitored and that only expected return traffic from established connections should be allowed through the NAT firewall. Overall, the focus is on minimizing the attack surface and ensuring that the router is not exposed to the public Internet without proper safeguards.


--- 2022 ---
Steve emphasizes the importance of ensuring that home routers are secure and properly configured. He recommends using routers that support isolated guest networks, which can help segment IoT devices from the main network, enhancing security. He advises checking that guest networks do not share the same subnet to prevent devices from communicating with each other. Additionally, he suggests keeping routers updated with the latest firmware to protect against vulnerabilities. Steve also highlights the need to disable features like Universal Plug and Play and remote management to minimize potential attack surfaces. Overall, he advocates for proactive measures to secure home networks against both external and internal threats.
